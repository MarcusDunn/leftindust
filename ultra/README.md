# MedIQ Ultra

Monorepo containing all front-end design for MedIQ.

## Mission
Ultra was designed with 2 goals in mind: mass scalability, and
clarity in design without the compromise of features. These 2 fundamental principles: despite sounding
so seemingly simple, have enabled us to take an unorthodox approach to medical technologiesâ€“or 
enterprise software in general, where the end user's experience is at the forefront of our software
design.

With these simple goals in mind, we believe that Ultra has the capacity to change
medical technologies for the better, and provide medical professionals with a product that
fundamentally alters the way they think of, and use EMR technologies forever.

## Todo
See the [MedIQ Ultra Taskboard](./TODO.md)

## Roadmap
See what's in store for Ultra at the [MedIQ Ultra Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)

## Setup
To set up Ultra for development, simply clone this repo and run `yarn install` in the root directory (Make sure to use yarn, as NPM lacks support for workspaces). This will install all the necessary dependencies for the packages to properly function.
